# Access-Control-Investigation
A cybersecurity project focusing on analyzing access control issues and providing actionable recommendations. This project includes an event log, employee directory analysis, and detailed insights into detected issues.
## Scenario
_The investigation was conducted following reports of unauthorized access attempts in the company's systems. Key objectives included identifying vulnerabilities, analyzing event logs, and improving access control mechanisms._

You’re the first cybersecurity professional hired by a growing business. Recently, a deposit was made from the business to an unknown bank account. The finance manager says they didn’t make a mistake. Fortunately, they were able to stop the payment. The owner has asked you to investigate what happened to prevent any future incidents.

To do this, you’ll need to do some accounting on the incident to better understand what happened. First, you will review the access log of the incident. Next, you will take notes that can help you identify a possible threat actor. Then, you will spot issues with the access controls that were exploited by the user. Finally, you will recommend mitigations that can improve the business' access controls and reduce the likelihood that this incident reoccurs.
## Notes, Issues, and Recommendations
[Notes, Issues, and Recommendations](./resources/notes-issues-recommendations.pdf): Tabularized findings and recommendations from the investigation.
### Key Findings:
- Multiple failed login attempts for critical systems.
- Accounts with administrative privileges used irregularly.

### Recommendations:
- Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA).
- Enforce a least-privilege access policy.
- Schedule regular audits of the employee directory.
## Resources
The following resources are included in this project for reference:

1. [Event Log](./resources/Event-Log.png): Detailed logs of system access attempts.
2. [Employee Directory](./resources/Employee-Directory.png): A comprehensive directory of employees and access levels.
